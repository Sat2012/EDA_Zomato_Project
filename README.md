`**Zomato Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**`

**Introduction**

Welcome to the Zomato Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! In this project, we embark on a journey to explore and analyze the Zomato dataset, which contains valuable information about restaurants across different countries and cities.

**Project Overview**

The objective of this project is to conduct a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis on the Zomato dataset. Through statistical analysis, visualization, and data exploration techniques, we aim to uncover insights and trends within the restaurant data, enabling us to gain a deeper understanding of the restaurant industry.
